  "description": "The axolotl is a neotenic salamander related to the tiger salamander. It's unique for its ability to remain in its larval form throughout its life, a trait known as neoteny. Axolotls have external gills, a cartilaginous skeleton, and can regenerate limbs and other body parts. They come in several color morphs including wild-type (brown/olive with gold speckles), leucistic (pale pink with black eyes), albino, and melanoid.",
